# URL-Shortener
URL Shortener to shorten the long URL's
URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" can be shortened to "https://w.wiki/U".

First clone the repo and then we need to install some library.
I used pyshorteners library.
To install pyshorteners type in pip install pyshorteners. let it do its work and then run the code with the python command.

Keep Coding !
